- [OrmLite](https://ormlite.com/) Lightweight Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Java Package.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
- [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) The OpenAPI Specification, previously known as the Swagger Specification, is a specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) Simplify API development for users, teams, and enterprises with the Swagger open source and professional toolset. Find out how Swagger can help you design and document your APIs at scale.
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client side consumption.
